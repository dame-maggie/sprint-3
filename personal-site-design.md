What is you site's primary purpose?
To be a portfolio of the skills I develop while learning to code web. And perhaps to advertise myself and my ability to potential employers.

Who is your target audience?
Fellow web design learners and potential employers.

How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?
I would like the entrance to the site to be clear and easy to navigate. The mobile version and the desktop version to be visually similar so it doesn't seem like a totally different design. And that this design will give some sense of who I am (working on this front), but will remain visually appealing and uncluttered so information will be easy to find. In terms of this as well, I would like to have something about  me (about who I am, etc.) to be prominently presented along with contact info.

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?
At the moment I want to have a few clear buttons on the front of my page that take you to each of the different areas rather than having these parts incorporated into that landing page (as I am unsure how much content we will have in terms of blogs and such). This will keep each of the area's content clear and uncluttered by excess details. There will be a top nav bar to ensure not only that the various pages remain connected to other areas, but also to keep a visual uniformity to them.
